->Given a sorted array arr[] of size N, some elements of array are moved to either of the adjacent positions, i.e., arr[i] may be present at arr[i+1] or arr[i-1] i.e. arr[i] can only be swapped with either arr[i+1] or arr[i-1]. The task is to search for an element in this array.

Input: arr[] =  {10, 3, 40, 20, 50, 80, 70}, key = 40
Output: 2 
Explanation: Output is index of 40 in given array i.e. 2

Input: arr[] =  {10, 3, 40, 20, 50, 80, 70}, key = 90
Output: -1
Explanation: -1 is returned to indicate the element is not present
